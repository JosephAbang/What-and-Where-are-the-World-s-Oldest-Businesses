# What and Where are the World's Oldest Businesses
## by DataCamp Projects x Joseph Abang

# Dataset 
I explored data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses: when were they founded, and which industries do they belong to?

In order to understand the world's oldest businesses, I first needed to use joining techniques to merge the data. From there, I used manipulation tools such as grouping and filtering to answer questions about these historic businesses.

## Summary of findings
* The oldest, continuously operating company in the world is called Kong≈ç Gumi (a construction company).
*  "Banking & Finance" is the most popular category.
